# ENV603-DataViz
Practice and tutorial for ENV603 S21

There are three .R files in this repo, with examples modified from Healy's Data Viz book: https://socviz.co/index.html#preface.
The goal is to practice working with GitHub, RProjects, and Tidyverse.

You should fork this repository (https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) and then checkout a new project in RStudio. 
Work through each .R file in order. 
After you complete each exercise, be sure to commit and push your changes. Before starting the next exercise, pull any changes.
As you work through each exercise, comment your script thoroughly and perform the suggested edits to each plot. 
The final product for each script is a figure.

You will submit this part of Assignment #9 by initiating a pull request.

Commit 1: Saving the plot from exercise 1 before editing it
